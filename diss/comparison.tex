\section{Comparison with Crust2.0}

Crust2.0 is a refinement of the Crust5.0 to a 2x2 degree grid from a 5x5 degree grid. Crust2.0 relies on reflection/refraction estimates of crustal structure in areas where such data exists. Areas without data are given values based on crust of a similar age and type that does have data.
