Introduction

Method

The receiver functions and crustal estimates within the EARS system are calculated in a completely automatic fashion using the iterative deconvolution
technique of XYZ and Ammon and the H-K stacking technique of Zhu and Kanamori.
In addition, the stacking is done with the phase-weighted stacking technique
of Schimmel and Paulssen.

Data Selection

The goals of the EARS project are to be as broad as possible with respect to 
usable data. Hence we have processed all broadband channels for all stations
available from the IRIS DMC, including both temporary and permanent stations.
This has given us at the present time about 1700 stations.

All events above magnitude 5.5 in the WHDF catalog from the NEIC are processed. 
For each of these events, receiver functions are calculated for all
 stations with data between 30 and 100 degrees
for which the P phase exists in the prem model are accepted.
However, only only events-station pairs for which the iterative deconvolution
has a greater than 80 percent match are used in the resulting stacks.

Processing

A standard set of processing steps are taken with all event-station pairs. 
First a window from 120 seconds before the P to 180 seconds after the P is 
requested from the IRIS DMC. Any seismograms containing gaps, or for which
there are not 3 components are rejected. We then calculate a simple signal
to noise comparing the variance of a long time window from 105 to 5 seconds
before the predicted P arrival with the variance of a short time window
from 1 second before to 5 seconds after the predicted P arrival. This is not
the same as traditional long to short term signal to noise ratios, but provides
a simliar measure of the usefulness of the P arrival. Earthquakes for which the
maximum signal to noise over the 3 components is less than 2 are rejected.

A cut operation is then performed to window the data to 30 seconds before the P
to 120 seconds after the P in preparation for the deconvolution. The mean and
trend are removed, a taper is applied and the overall gain from each channel's 
response is applied. We do not apply a full instrument deconvolution, instead
assuming that the response is relatively flat in the passband of interest.
The data is then filtered with a butterworth bandpass filter from 50 seconds
to 5 hertz.

The iterative deconvolution is then applied to the data. This is done with a 
gaussian width of 2.5. The iteration is limited to 400 steps or a percentage 
match of 99.99, which effectively means that all 400 steps are always applied.
Both radial and transverse receiver functions are calculated and are then 
stored in the database regardless of the percentage match that they acheive.

Stacking

Because low percentage match receiver functions are often contaminated with
noise or lack signal, we do not stack receiver functions for which the
percentage match is below 80 percent. For some stations, especially within
shortlived temporary deployments, this severly limits the number of receiver
functions with the stacks, however, for an automated system this seems a
reasonable threshold. The stacking technique of Zhu and Kanamori is based on
the idea of transfering the amplitudes of the receiver function from a time
based system into a system based on crustal thickness (H) and Vp/Vs ratio, (K)
by using the predicted times of the 3 principal crustal revibirations, Ps, PpPs
and PsPs/PpSs. Once this transformation has been done, the amplitudes no longer
have a time dependency, which eliminates the ray parameter as a variable. Thus,
earthquakes at different distances, with correspondingly different ray
parameters can be stacked.

In addition to this stacking idea based on predicted arrival times, we also make
use of phase-weights for the stacks. This is a non-linear stacking technique
that weights the straight amplitude stack by a sum of unit magnitude complex
values constructed from the instantaeous phase of the receiver function. This
technique greatly sharpens the stacks at the little expense of calculating the
hilbert transform of the receiver functions.
