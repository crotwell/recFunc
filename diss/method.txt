Receiver Function Calculation

Receiver functions determine near receiver earth structure by the strength and timing S waves reverberations generated by a P wave as it interacts with layer boundaries. There are four reverberations with significant energy, denoted Ps, PpPs, PsPs and PpSs. The Ps arrival is an incident P wave that converts to an S wave at the boundary and continues to the surface. The second, PpPs, is an incident P wave that travels across the boundary and to the surface, where it reflects back down to the boundary. At the boundary it reflects again converting into an S wave that travels to the surface. PsPs has a upgoing S wave leg from the boundary to the surface, a downging P wave leg to the boundary and an upgoing S wave leg to the surface. PpSs is almost the same, with the first upgoing and downgoing legs of switching wave types. The final two reverberations arrrive at the same time as they have the same number of P and S wave legs, just reordered.



The extraction of the S wave arrivals is possible due to the incident P wave appearing mostly on both the vertical component, while the S wave reverberations are mostly confined to the radial, along with the fact that the wave shapes of the reverberations should be the same as the initial P wave except for possible polarity reversal. Thus, by
